I am a Lecturer at the University of Malta. My expertise is focused on program analysis, applied to security and other high-level applications. My research work has been recently <a href="https://www.sigplan.org/Highlights/Papers/"> highlighted by ACM SIGPLAN </a> and <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2020/10/247600-madmax/fulltext"> Communications of the ACM</a>. I am also interested in the areas of energy efficient systems, smart contracts, semantics and generative programming. My research tools include decompilers and security analyzers for the Ethereum platform (<a href="https://github.com/nevillegrech/gigahorse-toolchain">Gigahorse</a>) and Java pointer and taint analysis frameworks (Doop, P/Taint and HeapDL). Previously, I was Reach High Fellow at the University of Athens, a Senior Research Associate at the University of Bristol, and have worked in industry as a Data Scientist and Software Engineer. I hold a PhD from the University of Southampton.
