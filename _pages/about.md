I am the Director and co-founder of <a href="https://dedaub.com">Dedaub</a>. My expertise is focused on program analysis, mostly applied to security applications. Before Dedaub I had a mostly academic career. I have authored the first work that applies static analysis to the security of smart contracts, this work was subsequently <a href="https://www.sigplan.org/Highlights/Papers/"> highlighted by ACM SIGPLAN </a> and <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2020/10/247600-madmax/fulltext"> Communications of the ACM</a>. Throughout my career I've also developed novel techniques and tools in the areas of energy efficient software development, smart contracts, semantics and generative programming. Some popular tools I have codeveloped include decompilers and security analyzers for the Ethereum platform (MadMax and Gigahorse) and Java pointer and taint analysis frameworks (Doop, P/Taint and HeapDL). Previously, I was Reach High Fellow at the University of Athens, a Senior Research Associate at the University of Bristol, and have worked in industry as a Data Scientist and Software Engineer. I hold a PhD from the University of Southampton.
