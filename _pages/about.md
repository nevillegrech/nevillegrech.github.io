I am currently a Reach High fellow (Malta research fellowship) and work with Yannis Smaragdakis at the University of Athens, as well as at the University of Malta. My main specialization is on blockchain security and program analysis. My current work includes decompilers and security analyzers for the Ethereum platform and Java whole-program and taint analysis frameworks. Previously, I was a Senior Research Associate at the University of Bristol, and have worked in industry as a Data Scientist and Software Engineer. I hold a PhD from the University of Southampton.
