I am a Reach High fellow at the University of Athens, as well as at the University of Malta. My expertise is focussed around program analysis, applied to security and other high-level applications. I have also published in the areas of energy efficient systems, smart contracts (including a distinguished paper at OOPSLA and a CACM research highlight), semantics and generative programming. My research tools include decompilers and security analyzers for the Ethereum platform (contract-library.com) and Java pointer and taint analysis frameworks (Doop, P/Taint and HeapDL). Previously, I was a Research Associate at the University of Bristol, and have worked in industry as a Data Scientist and Software Engineer. I hold a PhD from the University of Southampton.
